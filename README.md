## How To View

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install react-native.
3. Install the repo-specific dependencies using `npm install`.
4. [Setup a new firebase database](https://firebase.google.com/) and copy the API configuration into the file `firebase.config.js.sample`.  Then, rename that file to `firebase.config.js`.
5. Run the app in an emulator with `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.  Be sure to reference the [React-Native ReadMe](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/README.md) for information on this process.
